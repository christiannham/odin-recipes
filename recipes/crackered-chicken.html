      <li>While chicken is boiling, crush up all three sleeves of crackers, sit to the side</li><br>
      <li>Once chicken is fully cooked, shred chicken to desired consistency, and season with salt and pepper (to taste)</li><br>

      <li>Pour a layer of cracker crumbs over the chicken, and dot with butter</li><br>
      <li>Repeat this process until all chicken and cracker crumbs have been used<br>(I usually get three layers)</li><br>
      <li>Bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until casserole is bubbly and light brown</li><br>
